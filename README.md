ðŸ”‹ 18650 Lithium-Ion Battery Capacity Tester with ATtiny20 ðŸ”‹



If you have rebuilt or built a battery-pack then you understand the pain of buying cell only to find they don't even reach the rated capacity.



So to avoid this I recently designed a battery cell capacity tester using the ATtiny20 microcontroller! This circuit allows accurate measurement of 18650 lithium-ion cell capacity, helping assess battery health and performance.

Key features:

 âš¡ Precise discharge control for consistent results

 âš¡ Low-power ATtiny20 MCU for efficient operation

 âš¡ Data logging capability for analysis and comparison



The collected data can be displayed on any I2C LCD display.

This tool will allow you to test sample cells from a supplier before comitting to a large batch order. 

This tool is particularly useful for DIY battery packs, e-bike builders, and energy storage projects. Excited to refine and test further! ðŸš€
